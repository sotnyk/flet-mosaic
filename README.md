# flet-mosaic
Project for exploring flet framework (Python UI) via simple game creation

I'll try to repeat calculator-demo app from flet framework tutorial (including 
deployment a web app), but with a simple game from my childhood - Mosaic.
Maybe it has another name, but I've already used it when implementing it in 
Delphi many years ago.
